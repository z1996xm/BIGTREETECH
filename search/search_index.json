OS_Settings \u00b6 3.1 Network Settings \u00b6 3.1.1 Ethernet \u00b6 Plug-and-play with an Ethernet cable, no additional setup required. 3.1.2 WiFi Settings \u00b6 After the OS writes to the SD card, there is a FAT32 partition named BOOT , open system.cfg file with Notpad , Notpad++ or VSCode . Set WIFI_SSID as your actual wifi name and WIFI_PASSWD as your actual wifi password, The space character can be parsed normally without additional escape character. For example: WIFI_SSID=\"CB1 Tester\" 3.2 Overlays Settings \u00b6 After the OS writes to the SD card, there is a FAT32 partition named BOOT , open BoardEnv.txt file with Notpad , Notpad++ or VSCode . Set as required as shown in the figure below. The default value is console=display , This means that the UART0 of CB1 is used as the debugging port by default. We can use MobaXterm to connect to CB1 by UART0 and debug. If klipper wants to use UART0 to control the motherboard, we need to set it to console=serial , now klippe can use UART0 as /dev/ttyS0 . CB1 will automatically identify the HDMI resolution, but if your HDMI screen cannot report the resolution through the EDID normally, we can forcibly specify the resolution of CB1 output by uncomment extraargs=video and set the actual resolution. For example: BTT-HDMI7 resolution = 1024x600: extraargs=video=HDMI-A-1:1024x600-24@60 BTT-HDMI5 resolution = 800x480: extraargs=video=HDMI-A-1:800x480-24@60 Uncomment overlays=tft35_spi to enable TFT35 SPI screen. Uncomment overlays=mcp2515 to enable MCP2515 spi to canbus module. Uncomment overlays=tft35_spi mcp2515 If you want to use both TFT35 SPI screen and MCP2515 spi to canbus module uncomment the following overlays and parameters to release 'spidev1.1' to user space, And 'spidev1.1' cannot be used together with TFT35_SPI and MCP2515. overlays=spi-spidev param_spidev_spi_bus=1 param_spidev_spi_cs=1 param_spidev_max_freq=1000000 NOTE: TFT35 SPI and MCP2515 multiplex a group of SPI1 SPI1_CLK=PH6 SPI1_MISO=PH8 SPI1_MOSI=PH7 TFT35_SPI_CS=PC7 MCP2515_CS=PC11 MCP2515_IRQ=PC9 4.

Be careful not to select the wrong storage device, otherwise, the data will be formatted). Wait for the writing to finish. 1.3.2 CM4 eMMC Version \u00b6 (Note: eMMC version will not tun the system from the Micro SD card.) Install rpiboot For Windows: http://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/raw/master/win32/rpiboot_setup.exe \u200b For Mac and Linux: https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot#building Push the DIP switch 4 (USB OTG) and 3 (BOOT) to ON to enter BOOT mode. Plug the Type-C into the USB port of the computer(in order to avoid problems caused by the insufficient USB power supply of the computer, it is best to use an external 24V power supply to power the motherboard). Run sudo ./rpiboot(Mac/Linux) or rpiboot.exe on Windows, then the eMMC of CM4 will be recognized as a mass storage device by the computer (if rpiboot reports an error at this time, you can try to re-plug the USB). The step of using the Raspberry Pi Imager to write the OS image is exactly the same as the LITE version. Note: the SSH function should also be enabled. When the writing is completed, push the DIP switch 4 (USB OTG) and 3 (BOOT) back to OFF after power off, and power on again to enter the normal working mode. 1.4. System Settings (CM4) \u00b6 1.4.1 USB 2.0 Hub Ports \u00b6 M4P is designed with a USB 2.0 Hub, in order to save power consumption, the USB port of CM4 is disabled by default. If you want to enable it, you need to add the following content to the config.txt file: dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=host 1.4.2 DSI1 Display Interface \u00b6 The default display interface is HDMI. The onboard DSI port of M4P uses the DSI1 interface. You need to download the DSI1 driver and enter the following sentence in the command line: sudo wget https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/cmio/dt-blob-disp1-cam1.bin -O /boot/dt-blob.bin After downloading this driver and restarting, the screen of DSI1 will work normally. If you want to use the HDMI interface, you need to delete the downloaded /boot/dt-blob.bin driver and restart, then the HDMI can output normally. 1.4.3 CSI1 Camera \u00b6 The DSI1 driver downloaded in 4.4.2 DSI1 Display Interface also includes the CSI1 driver. If you just want to install the CSI1 driver, not DSI1, please find the driver you want to use at https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/licence.html and download it in the boot folder of CM4 and rename it to dt-blob.bin, and then refer to the settings here. https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-picamera/ 2. BIGTREETECH CB1 Setup steps \u00b6 2.1 Download OS Image \u00b6 If BIGTREETECH CB1 core board is used, You can only download and install the system image provided by BIGTREETECH: https://github.com/bigtreetech/CB1/releases 2.2 Download and Install Raspberry Pi Imager \u00b6 Install the official Raspberry Pi Imager: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ The system image of CB1 can also be written with this software. 2.3 Write OS Image \u00b6 Plug the Micro SD card into the computer via a card reader. Select Operating System. Select \"Use Custom\", then select a custom.img from your computer. Select the Micro SD card and click \"WRITE\" (Writing the image will format the Micro SD card. Be careful not to select the wrong storage device, otherwise, the data will be formatted). Wait for the writing to finish. 2.4 WIFI Setting \u00b6 Note: This step can be skipped if you are using a network cable connection.CB1 cannot directly use the Raspberry Pi Imager to set the WiFi name and password like CM4. After the OS image writing is completed, the MicroSD card will have a FAT32 partition recognized by the computer, find \"system.cfg\" Open it with Notepad, replace WIFI-SSID with your WiFi name, and PASSWORD with your password. 3. Configure the motherboard \u00b6 3.1 ssh connect to device \u00b6 Install the ssh application Mobaxterm: https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/downloadhome-edition.html Insert Micro SD card to M4P, wait for system to load after power on, aprox. 1-2min The device will automatically be assigned a IP address after successfully connected to the network Find the device IP address in your router page Or use the https://angryip.org/ tool\uff0cscan all IP address in the current network organize by names, find the IP named Fluidd, Mailsail (CM4) or Hurakan (CB1) like shown below Open Mobaxtermand click \u201cSession\u201d, and click \u201cSSH\u201d\uff0cinset the device IP into Remote host and click \u201cOK\u201d (note: your computer and the device needs to be in the same network) Input the login name and password to enter the SSH terminal interface CM4: login as: pi password: raspberry CB1: login as: biqu password: biqu 3.2 Compile firmware \u00b6 After ssh successfully connected to the device, enter in terminal: cd ~/klipper/ make menuconfig Compile with the configuration shown below(if the options below is not available, please update you Klipper source code to the newest version) [*] Enable extra low-level configuration options Micro-controller Architecture (STMicroelectronics STM32) ---> Processor model (STM32G0B1) ---> Bootloader offset (8KiB bootloader) ---> Clock Reference (8 MHz crystal) ---> Communication interface (USB (on PA11/PA12)) ---> Run make to compile firmware\uff0c\u201dklipper.bin\u201d file will be generated in home/pi/kliiper/out folder when make is finished, download it onto your computer using the ssh application. 3.3 Firmware update \u00b6 3.3.1 Update using SD Card \u00b6 Rename klipper.bin to \u201dfirmware.bin\u201d, Copy to the SD card root directory, insert the SD card into the SD card slot of the M4P, click the \u201creset\u201d button or power on again. The firmware will be updated automatically. After the update, the \"firmware.bin\" in the SD card will be renamed as \"FIRMWARE.CUR\".
