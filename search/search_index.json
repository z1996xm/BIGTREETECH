Set as required as shown in the figure below. The default value is console=display , This means that the UART0 of CB1 is used as the debugging port by default. We can use MobaXterm to connect to CB1 by UART0 and debug. If klipper wants to use UART0 to control the motherboard, we need to set it to console=serial , now klippe can use UART0 as /dev/ttyS0 . CB1 will automatically identify the HDMI resolution, but if your HDMI screen cannot report the resolution through the EDID normally, we can forcibly specify the resolution of CB1 output by uncomment extraargs=video and set the actual resolution. For example: BTT-HDMI7 resolution = 1024x600: extraargs=video=HDMI-A-1:1024x600-24@60 BTT-HDMI5 resolution = 800x480: extraargs=video=HDMI-A-1:800x480-24@60 Uncomment overlays=tft35_spi to enable TFT35 SPI screen.
