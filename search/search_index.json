Set WIFI_SSID as your actual wifi name and WIFI_PASSWD as your actual wifi password, The space character can be parsed normally without additional escape character. For example: WIFI_SSID=\"CB1 Tester\" Overlays Settings \u00b6 After the OS writes to the SD card, there is a FAT32 partition named BOOT , open BoardEnv.txt file with Notpad , Notpad++ or VSCode . Set as required as shown in the figure below. The default value is console=display , This means that the UART0 of CB1 is used as the debugging port by default. We can use MobaXterm to connect to CB1 by UART0 and debug. If klipper wants to use UART0 to control the motherboard, we need to set it to console=serial , now klippe can use UART0 as /dev/ttyS0 . CB1 will automatically identify the HDMI resolution, but if your HDMI screen cannot report the resolution through the EDID normally, we can forcibly specify the resolution of CB1 output by uncomment extraargs=video and set the actual resolution. For example: BTT-HDMI7 resolution = 1024x600: extraargs=video=HDMI-A-1:1024x600-24@60 BTT-HDMI5 resolution = 800x480: extraargs=video=HDMI-A-1:800x480-24@60 Uncomment overlays=tft35_spi to enable TFT35 SPI screen. Uncomment overlays=mcp2515 to enable MCP2515 spi to canbus module. Uncomment overlays=tft35_spi mcp2515 If you want to use both TFT35 SPI screen and MCP2515 spi to canbus module uncomment the following overlays and parameters to release 'spidev1.1' to user space, And 'spidev1.1' cannot be used together with TFT35_SPI and MCP2515. overlays=spi-spidev param_spidev_spi_bus=1 param_spidev_spi_cs=1 param_spidev_max_freq=1000000 NOTE: TFT35 SPI and MCP2515 multiplex a group of SPI1 SPI1_CLK=PH6 SPI1_MISO=PH8 SPI1_MOSI=PH7 TFT35_SPI_CS=PC7 MCP2515_CS=PC11 MCP2515_IRQ=PC9 Write_OS \u00b6 Download the OS Image \u00b6 Please download and install the OS image we provided: https://github.com/bigtreetech/CB1/releases Download and Install Writing Software \u00b6 The official Raspberry Pi Imager: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ balenaEtcher: https://www.balena.io/etcher/ Both of the above software can be used, just choose one to download and install Format SD card \u00b6 Normally, you can format the SD card with the tools provided by the computer system.
