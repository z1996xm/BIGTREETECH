## **Introduction**

EZ2130, EZ2208, EZ2209, EZ2225, EZ2226, EZ6609 are plug-in stepping motor drive modules designed by our company, which have excellent performance, convenient plugging, beautiful and practical.

## **Main Features**

- StealthChop can realize the locking silence of the motor and the silence when the motor is running at low speed. It is recommended to select when the maximum speed of the motor is lower than 300 RPM;

- SpreadCycle can achieve silence and low power consumption in a wide range of speed and torque. It is recommended to select when the maximum speed of the motor exceeds 300 RPM;

- StallGuard2 ™： The limitless switch can be used to detect the locked rotor of the motor (limit switch is recommended);

- The newly developed board frame and new connector are used to let customers experience the beauty and avoid the accident of old drive pin stabbing hands;

- The new customized heat sink is adopted to enhance the heat dissipation ability and protect the drive chip from external damage;

- The environment-friendly packaging method improves the cost performance of the product.
