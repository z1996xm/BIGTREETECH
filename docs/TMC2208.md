#### **UART mode**

Note: TMC2208 v3.0 has two modes from our factory : step / dir and UART mode.

Customers can choose according to your own needs.



<p>The user who purchases the step / dir mode driver shall perform the following hardware operations on the driver module before wiring (the user who purchases the UART mode driver does not need any welding operations): </p>



Weld J2 as shown in the purple area, and put the driver in UART mode

**The benefits of UART mode:**

1.Motor current can be set arbitrarily by firmware.

2.Micro-steps can be set arbitrarily by firmware (up to 256 actual micro-steps);

3.The actual and interpolated microsteps can be combined to achieve maximum 

torque.

4.Firmware can dynamically switch stepper motors between stealthChop2 and spreadCycle modes through UART.

5.When the motor is not moving, the standby current of the motor can be reduced dynamically (through UART).

**Potentiometer regulation instructions:**

<p>Clockwise Rotating Potentiometer - Reduces Vref, thereby reducing drive current; Counterclockwise rotating potentiometer - Increase Vref, thereby increasing the driving current. </p>

The accurate voltage of Vref can only be measured when the main board is supplied with 12V or 24V voltage.

<p>The range of Vref value: default value: 1V (+0.2); MAX: 2V; MIN: 0V;Rotating potentiometer must not use too much force to prevent irreversible damage to the potentiometer; when the counter-clockwise rotation reaches the maximum, if it continues to rotate, it will become the minimum; similarly, when the clockwise rotation reaches the minimum, if it continues to rotate, it will become the maximum.</p>

## **Software Configuration**

For example，(Marlin-2.0)BIGTREETECH SKR V1.3 ：

**Configuration.h files** 

<img src=img/TMC2208/TMC2208_Config_h.png width="600"/>

TMC2208 - means you want to control SilentStepStick through UART.

TMC2208_STANDALONE - does not use UART control but STEP/DIR .

TMC2208 SilentStepStick，In other words plug and play.

**Configuration_adv.h files**

**Pins_BIGTREE_SKR_V1.3.h file**

After the firmware is changed, burned the firmware and check whether the driver is correctly installed is detected.

## **Precautions**

<p>1. When hardware chooses UART working mode, cautiously use soldering iron to prevent scalding hands. After treatment, carefully observe whether there is residual tin slag in the module. It must be cleaned up to prevent short circuit burning of the module.</p>

<p>2.Pay attention to the line sequence and IO port when wiring. If the wrong line is connected, the drive will not work.</p>

<p>3.When inserting drive into the main board, pay attention to see the direction of drive, can not insert backward, to prevent drive from burning.</p>

<p>4.Make sure to do a good job in heat dissipation (heat sink + heat dissipation fan) before driving to prevent abnormal operation of the drive.</p>
