# TMC5160

## **Introduction**

<p>TMC5160 is a high-power stepper motor driving control chip, which has externally expanded power MOS tube, the <br>maximum current can reach 20A, low heat when working.</p>

<p>Supporting TRINAMICS unique stealthChop2 mode eliminates motor noise by reducing resonance and achieves a<br> silent effect.StallGuard2 ™ blocking rotation detection is a safe stop to detect the motor and replaces a mechanical<br> stop switch.It can achieve stepping motor torque control or sensorless back to the origin.</p>

<p>dcStep ™ can let the motor run near its limit load and speed limit, can be achieved in the absence of any step 10 times<br> or more dynamic range.</p>

<p>spreadCycle ™ chopper algorithm has high precision, used for high dynamic motor sports and current wave absolutely<br> clean. Low noise, low resonance and low vibration chopper.</p>

<p>coolStep ™ current control function, optimize the drive performance, balance the speed and motor torque and optimize<br> energy efficiency, drive smoothly and no noise, energy consumption can be reduced by 75%.</p>

<p>TMC5160 is an expansion of the TMC2100, TMC2130 and </p>

<p>TMC5130 series to higher voltages and higher motor currents.</p>

## **Main Features**

- <p>External power MOS tube can support larger current, the maximum current can reach 20A (because the module is<br> limited by area, the current cannot exceed)</p>

- Super-mute mode

- Low calorific value

- can prevent motor shake(5)not easy to lose step

- can drive 57 stepper motor
